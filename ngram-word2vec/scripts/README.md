### Scripts for Getting Google Books Ngram Data

The scripts are for pulling and processing data from the Google Books Ngram dataset. By default, 
it pulls the english-fiction-all 5-grams. This can be modified in the [download script](download.py)

[This bash script](run_pipeline.sh) describes how to run the scripts.
